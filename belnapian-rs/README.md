# Belnapian

Belnapian is a library that provides basic types and operations for
[Belnap's 4-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-valued_logic#Belnap).

This library does not intend to be a full implementation of all the related
formalisms and algorithms for Belnap's logic, but rather a small and simple
building block.

In addition to basic operations for Belnap's 4-valued logic, this library
also provides:
- A simple implementation of 3-valued logic operations (with the `Unknown`
  value)
- An extension of Belnap's 4-valued logic to a 15-valued logic (where we
  have 11 "unknown" values).
